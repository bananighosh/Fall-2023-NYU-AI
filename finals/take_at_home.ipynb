The techniques that have been developed in this field are very useful for other tasks such as semi-supervised learning, representation learning, and reinforcement learning. In this problem statement we attempt to prepare you to understand the basics of a technique that has been very successful in generative modeling: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Understanding VAEs is  the key for you to get a head start with more advanced models such as [Stable Diffusion that are all the rage these days](https://clipdrop.co/stable-diffusion-turbo).\n",
